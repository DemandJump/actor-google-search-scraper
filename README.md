## Why

Typical use cases for Google search crawling, among thousands of others, are:

<ul>
    <li>Monitor how your website performs in SEO.</li>
    <li>Analyze advertisements for a given set of keywords.</li>
    <li>Monitor your competition in both organic and paid results.</li>
    <li>Build a URL list for certain keywords.</li>
</ul>

## Input

This actor currently supports only Google text search and doesn't other types such as image or news search.

Queries can be provided as a list of strings or full Google search URLs. Additionally, you can configure country and
location but these settings apply to entered queries only and not to a full Google search URLs.

For more information on input see the <a href="?section=input-schema">specification</a>.

## Output

By default each result item contains search results, ads and additional info for one search results page:

If you are interested in organic results only then you can use a combination of query parameters `fields=searchQuery,organicResults`
and `unwind=organicResults` to obtain a plain array of organic results. Original URL of a dataset is in a form

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]
```

where the format is one of `csv`, `html`, `xlsx`, `xml`, `rss` and `json`. By adding new parameters

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]&fields=searchQuery,organicResults&unwind=organicResults
```

you obtain a following result:

```json
[
  {
    "searchQuery": {
      "term": "Restaurants in Prague",
      "page": 0,
      "type": "SEARCH",

## Proxies

This actor requires access to [Google SERP proxy](https://www.apify.com/docs/proxy#google-serp).
Every user at Apify platform has limited number of queries each month for free as you can see in your
[account](https://my.apify.com/account). If you need more queries please contact [Apify support](https://www.apify.com/contact)
to get your limits increased.

## Notes

<ul>
    <li>
        This actor uses special proxies to avoid ban which may result in low speed of crawling especially for subsequent pages.
    </li>
    <li
        If you need to scrape the first 100 results then you can decrease duration of crawl more than ten times by setting
        `resultsPerPage=100` instead of crawling 10 pages each with 10 results.
    </li>
</ul>
