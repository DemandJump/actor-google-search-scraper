# Google Search Scraper

The actor crawls [Google Search](https://www.google.com/search) result pages (SERPs)
and extracts data from HTML pages to a structured format such as JSON, XML or Excel.
Specifically, the actor extracts the following data from each Google Search results page:

- Organic results
- Ads
- Product ads
- Related queries
- Additional custom attributes

Note that the actor doesn't support special types of searches,
such as Google Shopping, Images or News.

## Use cases

For many people, Google Search is the entry point to the internet,
so how they rank on Google is really important for businesses.
Unfortunately, Google Search doesn't provide a public API, so the only way to monitor
search results and ranking is to use [web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping).

Typical use cases are:

- [Search engine optimization (SEO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)
— Monitor how your website performs on Google for certain queries over a period of time.
- Analyze ads for a given set of keywords.
- Monitor your competition in both organic and paid results.
- Build a URL list for certain keywords. This is useful if you, for example, need good relevant starting points when scraping web pages containing specific phrases.

## Input settings

The actor gives you fine-grained control about what kind of Google Search results you'll get.
You can specify the following settings:

- Query phrases or raw URLs
- Country & language
- Exact geolocation
- Number of results per page
- Mobile or desktop version

For a complete description of all settings,
see the [input specification](https://www.apify.com/apify/google-search-scraper?section=input-schema).


## Usage

To use the actor, you'll need access to [Apify Proxy](https://apify.com/proxy)
and have a sufficient limit for Google SERP queries
(you can view this on your [Account](https://my.apify.com/account) page).
New Apify users have a free trial of Apify Proxy and Google SERPs,
which lets you try this actor free of charge.
Once the Apify Proxy trial is expired,
you'll need to subscribe to a [paid plan](https://apify.com/pricing) in order to keep using this actor.
If you need to increase your Google SERP limit or have any questions,
please contact [Apify support](https://apify.com/contact).


## Results

The actor stores its result in a dataset, from which you can export it
to various formats, such as JSON, XML, CSV or Excel.
For each Google Search results page, the actor creates one record
in the dataset, which looks as follows (in JSON):

```json

    "page": 1,

The results are stored in the default dataset associated with the actor run.
From there, you can export it to various formats using the [Get dataset items](https://www.apify.com/docs/api/v2#/reference/datasets/item-collection/get-items)
API endpoint. Note that the API endpoint accepts various parameters
that let you control what kind of data you'll get.

For example, if you are only interested in organic results,
then you can use a combination of query parameters `fields=searchQuery,organicResults`
and `unwind=organicResults` to obtain a plain array of organic results.
The original URL of a dataset has the form:

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]
```

where the format is one of `csv`, `html`, `xlsx`, `xml`, `rss` and `json`.
By adding the following query parameters

```
https://api.apify.com/v2/datasets/[DATASET_ID]/items?format=[FORMAT]&fields=searchQuery,organicResults&unwind=organicResults
```

you obtain the following result:

```json
[
  {
    "searchQuery": {
      "term": "Restaurants in Prague",
      "page": 1,
      "type": "SEARCH",

## Tips and tricks

Crawling of the second and further result pages might be slower than the first page.
If you need to scrape the first 100 results,
then you can greatly improve the speed of the crawl by setting
`resultsPerPage=100` instead of crawling 10 pages each with 10 results.
